The classic counterexample is $f_n = n \\cdot \\chi_{[0, 1/n]}$ on $[0,1]$. Here $f_n \\to 0$ pointwise (for any $x > 0$, eventually $x > 1/n$ so $f_n(x) = 0$), and $\\int |f_n| = n \\cdot (1/n) = 1 \\leq 1$ for all $n$.

Let me reconsider the problem.\n\nActually, looking at this again, maybe the problem is assuming we're on a finite measure space, or there's dominated convergence that applies. But uniform boundedness of $\\int |f_n|$ alone doesn't give us dominated convergence.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem means $|f_n| \\leq M$ (pointwise bound) rather than $\\int |f_n| \\leq M$ (integral bound)? That would make this a straightforward application of the Dominated Convergence Theorem.\n\nLet me re-read: \"with \u222b|f_n| \u2264 M for some constant M\"\n\nHmm, if this is interpreted as the integral being bounded, then the statement is false as I showed.\n\nBut if it's interpreted as $|f_n| \\leq M$ pointwise (i.e., the functions are uniformly bounded), then this is Bounded Convergence or follows from DCT with dominating function $g = M$.\n\n\nOn a finite measure space where $\\mu(X) < \\infty$, pointwise boundedness $|f_n| \\leq M$ would give $\\int |f_n| \\leq M \\cdot \\mu(X)$, but the reverse direction doesn't hold\u2014an integral bound doesn't guarantee pointwise boundedness. The most sensible reading is that the problem intends $|f_n| \\leq M$ as a uniform pointwise bound on the functions themselves.\n\nUsing Fatou's lemma, if $f_n \\to f$ pointwise and $\\int |f_n| \\leq M$, then $\\int |f| \\leq \\liminf \\int |f_n| \\leq M$, so $f$ is integrable. However, establishing $\\int f_n \\to \\int f$ requires additional structure. The Vitali Convergence Theorem provides one path: on a finite measure space, if $f_n \\to f$ in measure and the sequence is uniformly integrable, then the integrals converge.\n\nThe Generalized Dominated Convergence Theorem offers another approach: if $f_n \\to f$ a.e., $|f_n| \\leq g_n$ a.e., and $g_n \\to g$ a.e. with $\\int g_n \\to \\int g < \\infty$, then $\\int f_n \\to \\int f$. The problem statement likely intends one of these scenarios\u2014either uniform boundedness on a finite measure space, pointwise domination by an integrable function, or the generalized version with converging majorants.\n\nAssuming the condition is $|f_n(x)| \\leq M$ for all $n$ and $x$ on a finite measure space, I can set $g(x) = M$, which is integrable since $\\int g = M \\cdot \\mu(X) < \\infty$. With $f_n \\to f$ pointwise and $|f_n| \\leq g$, the Dominated Convergence Theorem immediately gives $\\int f_n \\to \\int f$.\n\nIf instead the bound is on the integrals themselves\u2014$\\int |f_n| \\leq M$\u2014the situation is different and would require additional assumptions. The standard result here is the Bounded Convergence Theorem, which applies when we have a uniform pointwise bound on the functions themselves in a finite measure setting.\n\nThe theorem states: if $f_n \\to f$ pointwise and $|f_n| \\leq M$ for all $n$, then $\\int f_n \\, d\\mu \\to \\int f \\, d\\mu$.\n\nTo establish this, I note that $|f| \\leq M$ follows from the pointwise convergence and bound. Setting $g_n = f_n - f$, we have $g_n \\to 0$ pointwise with $|g_n| \\leq 2M$. Since the measure space is finite, the Dominated Convergence Theorem applies directly, giving $\\int g_n \\to 0$.\n\nAlternatively, using Egorov's theorem: for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a set $E$ with $\\mu(E) < \\epsilon/(4M)$ where $g_n \\to 0$ uniformly on the complement. For sufficiently large $n$, we have $|g_n(x)| < \\epsilon/(2\\mu(X))$ on $X \\setminus E$. This bounds the integral of $|g_n|$ by splitting it into the uniform convergence region and the exceptional set, where the exceptional set contributes at most $\\epsilon/2$ and the uniform region contributes at most $\\epsilon/2$."

For example, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}$ is algebraic, but $x^3 - 2$ doesn't split completely in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSo the problem statement must be that $E/F$ is an algebraically closed extension, meaning $E$ is algebraically closed. Or perhaps $E$ is the algebraic closure of $F$.\n\nLet me re-read the problem. \"Let F be a field and E/F an algebraic extension. Show that every polynomial in F[x] splits completely in E[x].\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem means that $E$ is the algebraic closure of $F$? That would make the statement true.\n\nActually wait, let me reconsider. If $E$ is an algebraic extension of $F$ such that $E$ is algebraically closed, then $E$ would be THE algebraic closure of $F$. And in that case, every polynomial in $F[x]$ would split completely in $E[x]$.\n\nActually, I think I misread the problem. Let me assume the problem is:\n\n\"Let $F$ be a field and $E/F$ be its algebraic closure. Show that every polynomial in $F[x]$ splits completely in $E[x]$.\"\n\nThis makes sense. If $\\bar{F}$ is the algebraic closure of $F$, then every polynomial $f(x) \\in F[x]$ has all its roots in $\\bar{F}$.\n\n\nFor any polynomial $f(x) \\in F[x]$, any root $\\alpha$ satisfies $f(\\alpha) = 0$, making $\\alpha$ algebraic over $F$. Since $E$ is algebraically closed and contains all algebraic elements over $F$, every root of $f$ must lie in $E$, so $f$ splits completely there. The algebraic closure is precisely the field containing $F$ that is algebraically closed and consists entirely of elements algebraic over $F$.\n\nHowever, the given condition that $E/F$ is merely algebraic doesn't guarantee $E$ is algebraically closed. A polynomial in $F[x]$ might have roots outside $E$ unless $E$ itself is algebraically closed. I suspect the problem intends for $E$ to be an algebraic closure of $F$, or perhaps the statement should specify that $E$ is an algebraically closed extension.\n\nIf we're working with an algebraic closure $\\bar{F}$ instead, then any polynomial $f(x) \\in F[x]$ must split completely in $\\bar{F}[x]$ since $\\bar{F}$ is algebraically closed. For any root $\\alpha$ of $f$, the element $\\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$ and therefore belongs to $\\bar{F}$ by definition of the algebraic closure. , and since $\\bar{F}$ is algebraically closed, every polynomial in $F[x]$ has all its roots in $\\bar{F}$.\n\nThe key insight is that algebraic closure guarantees every polynomial splits completely. Since polynomials over $F$ are also polynomials over $\\bar{F}$, and $\\bar{F}$ is algebraically closed, they must split in $\\bar{F}$. I'm realizing the problem likely intends $E$ to be the algebraic closure of $F$ rather than just an algebraic extension\u2014that's what makes the statement true.

        "reasoning": " We need to parse the problem: \"Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset. Show that the localization S\u207b\u00b9R is an integral domain.\"\n\nWait, but we need to be careful: The.previous statement is not stub correct: If R is an integral domain and S is a multiplicative subset not containing zero, then the localization S^{-1}R is also an integral domain. But the statement as given \" kahval\"? The phrase \"Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset. Show that the localization S\u207b\u00b9R is an integral domain.\" is ambiguous: Usually we need assumptions: R is an integral domain (or maybe R is a commutative ring?), S is a multiplicative subset not containing zero (so S consists of non-zero divisors? Actually we need S not containing zero and not containing zero divisors? Let's think.\n\nFirst, integral domain: A commutative ring with unity where zero product property holds: if ab = 0 then a = 0 or b = 0.\n\nIf we localize a commutative ring R at a multiplicative set S (containing 1 but not 0?), the localization S^{-1}R is the set of equivalence classes of pairs (r, s) with r\u2208R, s\u2208S, with (r,s) ~ (r', s') iff there exists t\u2208S such that t(rs' - r's) = 0. The ring operations are defined as usual. If R is integral domain and 0 \u2209 S, then S^{-1}R is also an integral domain (provided S doesn't contain zero divisors). However, the statement as&&? Let's examine.\n\nBut the problem as given: \"Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset. Show that the localization S\u207b\u00b9R is an integral domain.\" Actually maybe they omitted the hypothesis: maybe R is an integral domain. Or they want to show that S^{-1}R is an integral domain if R is an integral domain and S doesn't contain zero? Or maybe they want to show that S^{-1}R is an integral domain (i.e., the localization of R at S is the total quotient ring (field of fractions) when R is a domain and S = R\\{0}? Actually total quotient ring of an integral domain is a field, but a general localization may not be an integral domain unless S excludes zero divisors. For instance, consider R = Z/6Z, which is not an integral domain, and let S = {1,2,4} (multiplicative set containing zero divisor 2?), then S^{-1}R may have zero divisors? Actually Z/6Z is not an integral domain anyway. So maybe we need to assume R is an integral domain and S is multiplicative subset not containing zero? Let's check typical statements:\n\n- If R is an integral domain, and S is a multiplicative subset of R not containing 0, then S^{-1}R is also an integral domain.\n\n- In particular, if R is an integral domain, then the field of fractions K = S^{-1}R where S = R\\{0} is a field, which is also an integral domain.\n\nThus the problem likely expects to prove: If R is an integral domain, then S^{-1}R is an integral domain (provided S is a multiplicative subset of R not containing zero). However, the problem statement didn't specify R is an integral domain. Could be a mistake. Or perhaps the phrase \"integral domain\" might be used loosely to refer to a commutative ring with unity where zero is not allowed? Wait, \"integral domain\" is a property of a ring, not the multiplicative set. So the statement \"Show that S^{-1}R is an integral domain\" can only be meaningful if the original ring R is an integral domain, else you cannot guarantee the localization is an integral domain. So presumably the hypothesis R is an integral domain is implicit but omitted. Or maybe they want to show that S^{-1}R is always an integral domain? Actually any localization of a commutative ring with identity focal? Let's check an example: R = Z/6Z, S = {1,5} (5 is invertible element? Actually 5 is its own inverse modulo 6? 5*5 = 25 \u2261 1 mod 6). S = {1,5} is multiolving invertible elements, then S^{-1}R \u2245 R (since they are invertible). R is not an integral domain. So that would be a counterexample. So we need assumptions.\n\nThus standard theorem: If R is an integral domain, then any localization S^{-1}R is an integral domain (provided S does not contain 0). If S contains 0, then S^{-1}R is zero ring (since 0 invertible?), Actually if 0 \u2208 S, then the equivalence relation collapses everything? Let's recall: Localization at a multiplicative set S containing 0 yields zero ring: because any element (a,s) ~ (a,s) but if s = 0? Actually the definition often includes that 0 \u2209 S to avoid trivial localization. Usually S is defined as a multiplicative set not containing zero. But some definitions allow S to contain zero, then S^{-1}R is the zero ring. But zero ring is not an integral domain. So we must require S doesn't contain zero.\n\nThus we need to prove: Let R be an integral domain, S a multiplicative subset of R not containing 0. Then S^{-1}R is an integral domain.\n\nIf we want to be thorough: Show S^{-1}R is a commutative ring with unity (the localization construction yields a ring; we need to show it's an integral domain: that is, it has no zero divisors). So assume R is an integral domain (commutative with 1). Let S be a multiplicative subset; i.e., 1 \u2208 S, and if a,b \u2208 S then ab \u2208 S. Usually also assume 0 \u2209 S.\n\nDefine equivalence relation: (a,s) ~ (b,t) iff there exists u \u2208 S such that u(at - bs) = 0. Since R is a domain, this simplifies: (a,s) ~ (b,t) iff there exists u \u2208 S such that u(at - bs) = 0. Since u \u2260 0 and no zero divisors, that implies at - bs = 0, i.e., at = bs. So (a,s) ~ (b,t) iff at = bs. So in an integral domain, the equivalence condition simplifies to a t = b s (no need for extra u). Then define addition and multiplication as usual: (a/s) + (b/t) = (at +\u88ab\u5927\u5bb6\u5f53)/st? Actually (a/s) + (b/t) = (at +.blackDot? Wait: For principal ideal domain like Z, we have a/s + b/t = (at + bs)/st. Multiplication: (a/s)*(b/t) = (ab)/(st). Check that these are well-defined.\n\nThen show that S^{-1}R is an integral domain: Suppose (a/s)*(b/t) = 0/1 (zero element). Then (ab)/(st) ~ 0/1, i.e., there exists u \u2208 S such that u(ab*1 - 0*st) = u(ab) = 0. Since R is an integral domain and u \u2208 S, and S contains non-zero elements, u \u2260 0. Then ab = 0. Since R is a domain, either a = 0 or b = 0. Then_quantity? If a = 0 then (a/s) = 0/s = 0 (since 0\u3084?? Actually 0/s is zero element). Similarly for b. So product of non-zero elements cannot be zero.\n\nWait, need to check: For a product to be zero in S^{-1}R, we have (a/s)*(b/t) = (ab)/(st) = 0/1. That means there exists u \u2208 S such that u(ab*1 - 0*st) = u(ab) = 0. Since u \u2260 0, we get ab = 0 in R. Since R is an integral domain, a = 0 or b = 0. Then (a/s) = 0 or (b/t) = 0. Hence no zero divisors.\n\nBut also need to ensure that S^{-1}R is not the zero ring: The zero ring is not an integral domain because integral domain must have 1 \u2260 0. So need to require that S does not contain zero, making S^{-1}R non-zero. Indeed, if S contains zero, then for any (a,s), we have (a,s) ~ (0,1) because 0*(a*1 - 0*s) = 0, so everything is zero. So we must assume 0 \u2209 S.\n\nThus final answer: Under those assumptions, S^{-1}R is an integral domain.\n\nBut the problem might have a twist: Perhaps they want to show that the localization of any ring R at a multiplicative set S (maybe with certain conditions) is an integral domain? Let's consider possibility that the original ring R is any commutative ring (with unity) and S consists of non-zero-divisors. In that case, the localization S^{-1}R is also an integral domain? Actually yes: If S is a multiplicative set of non-zero-divisors (i.e., consists of regular elements: elements that are not zero divisors), then S^{-1}R is an integral domain if R is an integral domain? Wait, no: For a general ring, we can find a multiplicative set of regular elements, but the localization might still have zero divisors if original ring had zero divisors? Hmm.\n\nActually consider R = Z/6Z, which is not a domain. Let S = {1, 5} maybe, but 5 is invertible, so it's a unit. Units are regular (\u53ef\u60dc\u4e86). Then localization S^{-1}R \u2245 R because we invert units only. Then R itself is not a domain. So S^{-1}R is not\u4e1a\u7684 domain. So we need R to be a domain.\n\nThus the statement is untrue otherwise. So we need to assume R is an integral domain.\n\nAlternatively perhaps they want to show that localization of an integral domain at any multiplicative set not containing zero yields an integral domain. That's a standard result.\n\nThus answer must include:\n\n- Note: integral domain = commutative ring with identity where product of non-zero elements is non-zero.\n\n- The localization S^{-1}R for a multiplicative set S (not containing zero) is defined as equivalence classes a/s.\n\n- Show that S^{-1}R is a commutative ring with identity (this is standard).\n\n- Show that S^{-1}R has no zero divisors: Suppose (a/s)*(b/t) = 0/1, then there is u\u2208S such that u(ab) = 0. Since R is integral domain and u \u2208 S is non-zero, we have ab=0, then a=0 or b=0, giving a/s=0 or b/t=0.\n\n- Also need to argue that 0 \u2260 1 in S^{-1}R. This requires S does not contain zero. Indeed, if 0\u2208S, then S^{-1}R = 0. So we assume 0\u2209S.\n\nThus final proof.\n\nBut maybe they want to consider the ring of fractions (full quotient field) i.e., S = R\\{0} if R is integral domain, then S^{-1}R is a field. But not asked.\n\nBetter to provide a rigorous proof.\n\nWe can also show that S^{-1}R is isomorphic to a subring of the field of fractions of R if R is an integral domain: The map \u03c6: S^{-1}R \u2192 Frac(R) given by \u03c6(a/s) = a/s (in field of fractions) is injective. Since a subring of a field is an integral domain.\n\nThus alternative approach: Show S^{-1}R embeds into the field of fractions, thus it's an integral domain.\n\nBut perhaps they want to show that S^{-1}R is a domain assuming R is a domain and S \u2286 R\\{0}. So we need to provide a direct argument.\n\nWe might also need to show that the canonical map R \u2192 S^{-1}R is injective if S contains no zero divisors.\n\nBut the core: Show that S^{-1}R is an integral domain.\n\nLet's outline steps:\n\n**Goal**: Show S^{-1}R is an integral domain: i.e., it's a commutative ring with identity and has no zero divisors.\n\n**Assumptions**: R is a commutative ring with\u70b9\u540e unity; further, R is an integral domain (no zero divisors). S \u2286 R is a multiplicative set (i.e., 1\u2208S and if a,b\u2208S then ab\u2208S). Also assume 0\u2209S (so S consists of non-zero elements). Then S^{-1 EZ} is defined as the set of equivalence classes a/s with a\u2208R, s\u2208S, and (a\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d,s) ~ (b\u5904,t) if there exists u\u2208S such that u(at - bs)=0.\n\n**Proof**:\n\n1. Show the relation ~ is an equivalence relation: reflexive, symmetric, transitive. Straightforward.\n\n2. Define addition and multiplication on equivalence classes: (a/s)+(b/t) = (at + bs)/st, (a/s)*(b/t) = (ab)/(st). Show they are well-defined (i.e., independent of choice of representatives). This uses the fact that S is multiplicatively closed and that R is commutative.\n\n3. Show that the set S^{-1}R with theseDeleting operations forms a commutative ring with identity 1/1.\n\n4. Show that S^{-1}R has no zero divisors. Let x = a/s and y = b/t \u2208 S^{-1}R be such that xy = 0/1. Then (ab)/(st) ~ 0/1, i.e., there exists u \u2208 S with u(ab) = 0. Since u \u2208 S is non-zero and R has no zero divisors, we must have ab = 0. Since R is an integral domain, this implies a = 0 or b = 0. Consequently x = 0/s = 0 or y = 0/t = 0. Therefore, there are no non-zero zero divisors.\n\n5. Show 0 \u2260 1 in S^{-1}R: Since S does not contain 0, the equivalence class 0/1 is distinct from 1/1. Indeed, if 0/1 = 1/1 then there would exist u \u2208 S such that u(0*1 - 1*1) = -u = 0, implying u = 0, a contradiction. So 0 \u2260 1.\n\nThus S^{-1}R satisfies all axioms of an integral domain.\n\n**Alternative approach**: Since R is an integral domain, its total quotient field (field of fractions) Q = Frac(R) exists and is a field. The map \u03c6: S^{-1}R \u2192 Q defined by \u03c6(a/s) = a/s is well-defined and injective (if a/s = b/t in Q then at = bs, which also holds in S^{-1}R). Therefore S^{-1}R is isomorphic to a subring of a field, hence inherits the property of having no zero divisors.\n\n**Note**: If we drop the assumption that R is an integral domain or that 0\u2209S, the statement fails. For example, let R = Z/6Z (not a domain) and S = {1,5} (units). Then S^{-1}R \u2245 R is not an integral domain. Also, if S contains 0, then S^{-1}R = {0} is the zero ring, which is not an integral domain.\n\nThus the statement is proven.\n\nNow we need to present it properly.\n\nPotentially they want to show in full generality: If R is an integral domain, then any localization S^{-1}R (with S multiplicative and 0\u2209S) is also an integral domain. Provide a rigorous proof.\n\nWe'll produce a formal answer.\n\nAlso, note that in some textbooks, they treat a domain as a commutative ring with 1 \u2260 0 and no zero divisors. So we need to check that S^{-1}R is nontrivial. Since S doesn't contain zero, we have at least one element s\u2208S non-zero, so in the localization 1/1 \u2260 0/1.\n\nWe can also show that S^{-1}R is a subring of the field of fractions K of R. Indeed, the canonical map i: R\u2192S^{-1}R given by r \u21a6 r/1 is a ring homomorphism; when R is a domain, i is injective iff S \u2286 R\\{0} (i.e., S contains no zero divisors). But that's not required; we only need to show S^{-1}R is a domain.\n\nBetter to provide the\u4eba\u90fd\u77e5\u9053 proof.\n\nThus answer: S\u207b\u00b9R is an integral domain.\n\nNote: If we consider the case S = R\\{0} then S\u207b\u00b9R is a field (the fraction field). In general, S\u207b\u00b9R is a subring of that field.\n\nLet's answer accordingly.\n\nNow, we need to provide a solution. Must be clear about assumptions: R is.guild integral domain (or at the very least a commutative ring with unity with no zero divisors). S is multiplicative subset not containing zero. Then S\u207b\u00b9R is a domain.\n\nWe'll produce a step-by-step proof.\n\nWe can also mention that integral domain means no zero divisors and 1 \u2260 0. We'll need to show that in S\u207b\u00b9R the zero element is 0/1 and the identity is 1/1, and 0/1 \u2260 1/1.\n\nProof details:\n\n- Let x = a/s, y = b/t \u2208 S\u207b\u00b9R. Suppose xy = 0. Then there exists u \u2208 S such that u(ab) = 0. Because u is a non-zero divisor (since R is an integral gam), and u \u2208 S is non-zero. Therefore ab = 0. Then either a = 0 or b = 0. So x\u667a\u80fd zero or y zero.\n\n- Show that the additive identity 0/1 is not equal to multiplicative identity 1/ocese: If 0/1 = 1/1, then exists u \u2208 S such that u (0*1 - 1*1) = -u = 0, implies u = 0, contradiction.\n\nEverything else is standard.\n\nPotential nuance: If R is a domain, then any multiplicative set S (maybe including 0? Typically we require 0 \u2209 S). But if 0 \u2208 S, then S\u207b\u00b9R is the zero ring; some authors might\ufffd\u1031\u1038\ufffd say integral domain excludes zero ring, but we should note that condition.\n\nSo I'll produce a clear answer: Show that S\u207b\u00b9R is an integral domain with the above assumptions.\n\nNow I'd like to also flesh out the full convolution: define equivalence relation, show transitivity uses the cancellation property (if we have equality at*b? Actually we need to be careful: In general localization for arbitrary ring, we need the condition \"there exists u \u2208 S s.t. u(at - bs) = 0\" to define equivalence. For an integral domain, we can ignore the u because no zero divisors aside from zero. But if S may contain zero divisors, then we may need to keep the u. However, if R is an integral domain and S does not contain zero, then indeed any non-zero element of S is regular, so we can simplify to at = bs.\n\nBut if R has zero divisors, we must keep the u. However, to show S\u207b\u00b9R is a domain, we need the stronger condition that S consists of regular elements (i.e., non-zero divisators). Actually, if R has zero divisors but S contains only regular elements (i.e., non-zero divisors), then S\u207b\u00b9R can still be a domain? Let's examine: Suppose R has zero divisors, but S is the set of regular elements (non-zero divisors). Then S\u207b\u00b9R is the total ring of fractions, which might have zero divisors? Actually, the total ring of fractions of a ringJessica zero divisors is a ring where every regular element becomes a unit, and that ring is called the total quotient ring. It can have zero divisors if the original ring had them? I think the total quotient ring may have zero divisors coming from zero divisors that become zero after inverting regular elements? Let's consider R = Z/6Z. Regular elements are those not zero divisors: units only: {1,5}. S = units. Then S\u207b\u00b9R \u2245 R: we still have zero divisors 2*3 = 0. So it still has zero divisors. So need R to be integral domain.\n\nThus assume R is an integral domain.\n\nAlright, let's write an answer.\n\n---\n\nWill include the definitions, assumptions,Processed proof.\n\nPotential extension: Show that the field of fractions is a special case. Provide mention.\n\nProof steps:\n\n**Step 1:** Define S\u207b\u00b9R as the set of equivalence classes of pairs (a,s) under the relation: (a,s) ~ (b,t) iff \u2203u \u2208 S s.t. u(at - bs)=0. Show this is an equivalence relation.\n\n**Step 2:** Define addition and multiplication; show they are well-defined.\n\n**Step 3:** Verify ring axioms for S\u207b\u00b9R; it's a commutative ring with identity 1/1.\n\n**Step 4:** Show S\u207b\u00b9R is nontrivial: 0/1 \u2260 1/1 because 0 \u2209 S.\n\n**Step 5:** Prove no zero divisors: Suppose (a/s)*(b/t) = 0/1, then \u2203u \u2208 S s.t. u(ab)=0. Since u \u2260 0 and R is a domain, ab = 0. Therefore a=0 or b QObject::connect.\n\n**Conclude\u6ee4\u82af Additionally, if S = R\\{0} then S\u207b\u00b9R is a field.\n\nAlternatively, embed into field of fractions; because any subring of a field is an integral domain, so S\u207b\u00b9R is an integral domain.\n\nGive example and caution: If R is not a domain or if S contains zero, the statement fails.\n\nLet's be precise: The statement holds if R is an integral domain and S \u2286 R \\ {0}.\n\nNow craft answer accordingly.\n\nWe can also mention that a more general statement: If R is a domain, any localization at a multiplicative set not containing zero is again a domain.\n\nPotentially they'd ask: \"Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset.

Show that the localization S\u207b\u00b9R is an integral domain.\"\n\nBut careful as per our discussion: Without extra assumptions, this statement is false. But maybe they omitted \"integral domain\" from the hypothesis; maybe they meant \"If R is an integral domain and S a multiplicative subset not containing 0, then S\u207b\u00b9R is an integral domain.\" Let's answer that.\n\nThus answer: Provide proof.\n\nWe can mention that if R is a domain/logs, then the localization is a subring of its field of fractions thus a domain.\n\nAlternatively, we can directly argue as described.\n\nHence answer.\n\nTo be thorough, we could include the definition of integral domain: commutative ring with identity where 1 \u2260 0 and no zero divisors.\n\nThus answer.\n\n Recording the equivalence relation and proof that the product of non-zero fractions is non-zero.\n\nBetter to show that if a/s \u2260 0 and b/t \u2260 0,\u30c3 then ab \u2260 0, thus product is non-zero.\n\nLet's also note that S being a multiplicative set not containing zero ensures that s,t,u are all non-zero, so they are cancellable.\n\nThus final.\n\nNow let's craft the answer.\n\n---\n\nIn final answer, include:\n\n- Statement of theorem\u5f55\u50cf.\n\n- Assumptions: R is an integral domain; S \u2286 R \\ {0} is a multiplicative set (contains 1 and closed under multiplication).\n\n- Outline of proof: Show that S^{-1}R is a commutative ring with identity, then show it has no zero divisors and is non-zero.\n\n- Provide details of the equivalence relation and operations.\n\n- Show that if xy = 0 then x = 0 or y = 0.\n\n- Also show 0 \u2260 1.\n\n- Conclude S^{-1}R is an integral domain.\n\nOptionally include remark about field of fractions as a special case (S = R \\ {0}).\n\nAlso comment on necessity of assumptions; give counterexample otherwise.\n\nNow produce final answer.

        "reasoning": "The user wants a proof for the statement: \"Let $K/F$ be a finite Galois extension. Show that every intermediate field $E$ with $F \\subseteq E \\subseteq K$ is Galois over $F$.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of a Galois extension.\nThere are several equivalent definitions for a finite extension $K/F$:\n1.  $K/F$ is normal and separable.\n2.  The fixed field of the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/F)$ is $F$, i.e., $\\text{Fix}(\\text{Gal}(K/F)) = F$.\n3.  $|\\text{Gal}(K/F)| = [K:F]$.\n\nThe statement asks to show that for *every* intermediate field $E$, $E/F$ is Galois.\nThis statement seems suspicious. Is it true?\n\nLet's test with a counterexample.\nLet $F = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is the splitting field of $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. So $K/F$ is Galois.\nThe Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/F)$ is isomorphic to $C_2 \\times C_2$, so $|G| = 4$. The degree $[K:F] = 4$.\nThe intermediate fields are:\n1.  $E_1 = \\mathbb{Q}$\n2.  $E_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$\n3.  $E_3 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$\n4.  $E_4 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$\n5.  $E_5 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) = K$\n\nLet's check if $E_2/F$ is Galois.\n$E_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{2}$ is $x^2 - 2$.\nIs $E_2/F$ normal? The roots of $x^2-2$ are $\\pm \\sqrt{2}$. Both are in $E_2$. So $E_2/F$ is normal.\nIs $E_2/F$ separable? Yes, char is 0.\nSo $E_2/F$ is Galois.\n\nLet's try a different Galois extension.\nConsider the splitting field of $x^3 - 2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 3} = -1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\omega)$.\nThe roots of $x^3-2$ are $\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\omega\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\omega^2\\sqrt[3]{2}$.\n$[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 6$. The Galois group is $S_3$.\n\nLet's look at an intermediate field $E$.\nLet $E = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$.\n$[E:F] = 3$.\nIs $E/F$ Galois?\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^3 - 2$.\nThe roots are $\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\omega\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\omega^2\\sqrt[3]{2}$.\n$\\sqrt[3]{2} \\in E$.\nHowever, $\\omega\\sqrt[3]{2} \\notin \\mathbb{R}$, so $\\omega\\sqrt[3]{2} \\notin E$.\nThus, $E$ is not the splitting field of $x^3-2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, $E/F$ is not normal.\nTherefore, $E/F$ is not Galois.\n\nThis provides a clear counterexample to the statement \"every intermediate field E... is Galois over F\".\n\nWait, did I misread the prompt?\n\"Let K/F be a finite Galois extension. Show that every intermediate field E with F \u2286 E \u2286 K is Galois over F.\"\n\nPerhaps the user meant something else?\nMaybe the user meant \"Show that there exists an intermediate field E...\"? No, \"every\".\nMaybe the user meant \"Show that every intermediate field E... is Galois over F IF and only if the Galois group is abelian\"? No, that's a property (Galois iff $H \\triangleleft G$).\nMaybe the user meant \"Show that every intermediate field E... is Galois over F IF the Galois group is cyclic\"? No.\n\nLet me re-read the standard theorems.\nFundamental Theorem of Galois Theory:\n$K/F$ is Galois.\nThere is a bijection between intermediate fields $E$ ($F \\subseteq E \\subseteq K$) and subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/F)$.\n$E = K^H$ and $H = \\text{Gal}(K/E)$.\n$E/F$ is Galois $\\iff \\text{Gal}(K/E) \\triangleleft \\text{Gal}(K/F)$.\nSince subgroups of an arbitrary group are not necessarily normal, intermediate fields of a Galois extension are not necessarily Galois over the base field.\n\nSo, the statement as written is false.\n\nHowever, sometimes \"Galois\" is used loosely (e.g., in older texts or specific contexts) to mean \"normal\", or \"separable\", but usually, it means both.\nOr perhaps the user meant to ask a different question.\nMaybe: \"Show that every intermediate field E is separable over F\"? (True if K/F is separable).\nMaybe: \"Show that every intermediate field E is Galois over F IF the group is abelian\"?\nMaybe: \"Show that every intermediate field E is Galois over F IF K is the splitting field of $x^p-1$\"? (Cyclotomic).\n\nLet's check if there are any specific conditions where this holds.\nIf $G$ is abelian, every subgroup is normal, so every intermediate field is Galois.\nIf $G$ is nilpotent? No.\nIf the extension is radical? No.\n\nIs it possible the user is confusing \"K/F is Galois\" with \"E/F is Galois\"?\nOr is the user asking me to *disprove* it?\nUsually, prompts like \"Show that X\" imply X is true. If X is false, the prompt is usually \"Is X true? Show.\"\nOr maybe I missed a very subtle point. Is there any definition of Galois where this is true?\nDefinition: $E/F$ is Galois if the fixed field of $\\text{Aut}(E/F)$ is $F$.\nFor $E = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$, $\\text{Aut}(E/F)$ is trivial (since the conjugate is complex). The fixed field of the trivial group is $E$. So $\\text{Fix}(\\text{Aut}(E/F)) = E \\neq F$.\nSo $E/F$ is not Galois.\n\nConclusion: The statement is false.\n\nHow should I respond?\nI should explain that the statement is false and provide a counterexample.\nI should also explain the correct condition: An intermediate field $E$ is Galois over $F$ if and only if the corresponding subgroup $\\text{Gal}(K/E)$ is a normal subgroup of $\\text{Gal}(K/F)$.\nI should mention the case where it *is* true (e.g., when the Galois group is abelian).\n\nWait, is there any ambiguity in \"finite Galois extension\"?\nSome authors define Galois as \"splitting field of separable polynomials\".\nSome define it as \"fixed field of automorphism group is base field\".\nThese are equivalent for finite extensions.\nSeparability is preserved in intermediate fields.\nNormality is not.\nSo \"Galois\" = Normal + Separable. Separable holds, Normal doesn't. So Galois doesn't hold.\n\nMaybe the user meant: \"Show that every intermediate field E... is Galois over F IF K/F is abelian\"? No, the prompt doesn't say that.\nMaybe the user meant: \"Show that every intermediate field E is *separable* over F\"? (This is true).\nMaybe the user meant: \"Show that K is Galois over *E*\"?\nLet's check: $K/E$ is Galois?\n$K$ is splitting field of a set of separable polys over $F$. Those polys are in $E[x]$.\nSo $K$ is splitting field of separable polys over $E$. So $K/E$ is Galois.\nThis is a standard result: If $K/F$ is Galois, then $K/E$ is Galois for any intermediate $E$.\nDid the user write \"over F\" instead of \"over E\"?\n\"Show that every intermediate field E ... is Galois over F.\"\nThis explicitly asks for $E/F$.\n\nI will assume the user made a mistake or this is a trick question/check. I will provide a counterexample.\nI will also mention the true statement about $K$ being Galois over $E$.\n\nLet's draft the response.\n1. State clearly that the proposition is false.\n2. Provide the standard counterexample: $F = \\mathbb{Q}$, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\omega)$, $E = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$.\n3. Explain why $K/F$ is Galois (splitting field of $x^3-2$).\n4. Explain why $E/F$ is not Galois (not normal, missing complex roots).\n5. Provide the necessary and sufficient condition from the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory: $E/F$ is Galois $\\iff \\text{Gal}(K/E) \\triangleleft \\text{Gal}(K/F)$.\n6. Provide a case where it *is* true: if the Galois group is abelian (e.g., $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$).\n7. Briefly note the true statement: $K$ is always Galois over $E$.\n\nLet's double check the counterexample details.\n$f(x) = x^3 - 2$. Irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein (p=2).\nRoots: $\\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{2}, \\alpha\\omega, \\alpha\\omega^2$.\n$K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\omega)$.\n$[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\omega):\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)] [\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n$x^3-2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ but is it irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)$?\nThe degree of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)$ divides 3.\nIf $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)$, then $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)$, but $3 | [\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega):\\mathbb{Q}]$ impossible.\nSo $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\omega):\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)] = 3$.\nSo $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 6$.\n$G \\cong S_3$. $S_3$ is not abelian.\nTake $E = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\n$E/F$ is not Galois because $f(x)$ does not split in $E$.\nCorrect.\n\nWhat if the user meant \"Show that K is Galois over E\"?\nI should include this, just in case they miswrote the target field.\nStatement: \"If $K/F$ is Galois, then for every intermediate $E$, $K/E$ is Galois.\"\nProof:\n$K$ is the splitting field of a set of separable polynomials $\\Sigma \\subset F[x]$.\nSince $F \\subseteq E$, $\\Sigma \\subset E[x]$.\n$K$ is generated by the roots of $\\Sigma$, which are in $K$. So $K$ is the splitting field of $\\Sigma$ over $E$.\nThe polynomials are still separable.\nThus $K/E$ is Galois.\n\nWhat if the user meant \"Show that every intermediate field E is *separable* over F\"?\nProof:\n$K/F$ separable means every element of $K$ is separable over $F$.\nEvery element of $E$ is in $K$, so every element of $E$ is separable over $F$.\nThus $E/F$ is separable.\n\nWhat if the user meant \"Show that E is Galois over F IF AND ONLY IF $E$ is the fixed field of a normal subgroup\"?\nThat's part of the FTGT.\n\nGiven the phrasing \"Show that every...\", it's a strong statement. It is most likely a false premise question or a misremembered question.\nI will structure the answer to correct the premise.\n\nStructure:\n1. Direct Answer: The statement is false.\n2. Counterexample: $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\omega) / \\mathbb{Q}$ with $E = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$.\n3. Theoretical Explanation: $E/F$ is Galois $\\iff \\text{Gal}(K/E) \\unlhd \\text{Gal}(K/F)$. Not all subgroups are normal.\n4. Positive Variation 1: $K/E$ is always Galois.\n5. Positive Variation 2: If $\\text{Gal}(K/F)$ is abelian, then $E/F$ is Galois.\n\nThis covers all bases. It shows I understand the theory and the potential pitfalls of the question.\n\nIs there any interpretation where it could be true?\nMaybe if $F$ is algebraically closed? Then $K=F$. Then $E=F$. Trivial.\nMaybe if $F$ is finite? $K/F$ Galois implies $K$ is Galois (normal and separable). Over finite fields, every finite extension is Galois!\nWait.\nLet $F$ be a finite field. Let $K/F$ be a finite Galois extension.\nIs every intermediate field $E$ Galois over $F$?\nYes! Over finite fields, every finite extension is normal (cyclic extension) and separable (perfect field).\nSo, if the domain of discourse is restricted to finite fields, the statement is true.\nHowever, the prompt does not specify that $F$ is a finite field. It usually implies a general field (characteristic 0 or arbitrary).\nStandard convention: Unless specified, fields can be any field (like $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbb{C}$, $\\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, etc.).\nSince the statement is false for $\\mathbb{Q}$, it is generally false.\nI should mention the finite field case as a special exception where it *is* true.\n\nSo, plan:\n1. State it is generally false.\n2. Give $\\mathbb{Q}$ counterexample.\n3. Explain the group theory reason (normality of subgroups).\n4. Mention the exceptions where it is true (e.g. abelian Galois group, finite base fields).\n5. Mention related true facts ($K/E$ is Galois, $E/F$ is separable).\n\nLet's refine the abelian group example.\n$K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2$.\nSubgroups: $\\{e\\}, \\{e, \\sigma\\}, \\{e, \\tau\\}, \\{e, \\sigma\\tau\\}, G$.\nAll are normal (group is abelian).\nFixed fields: $K, \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}), \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}), \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}), \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThese are all Galois over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo in this specific case, the statement holds.\n\nSo the statement \"Let K/F be a finite Galois extension...\" is a hypothesis.\nConclusion \"...Show that every E is Galois\".\nThis is not a theorem. It's a false implication.\nThe only way to answer is to disprove it.\n\nWait, is it possible the user copied a question from a text where the previous sentence was \"Let G be an abelian group...\" or \"Let K/F be an abelian extension...\"?\nOr maybe \"Let $K/F$ be a *quadratic* extension\"? (Degree 2, so $E$ is either $F$ or $K$, both Galois).\nQuadratic extension is too specific.\nAbelian extension is the most likely intended context if the statement was meant to be true.\n\nBut I must answer the prompt as given.\n\nOne more check. Is there any definition of \"Galois extension\" that implies abelian?\nNo, Galois just means $\\text{Fix}(\\text{Aut}(K/F)) = F$.\nThis holds for $S_3$ extensions.\n\nOkay, I am confident the statement is false in general.\n\nSummary of the response:\nThe statement is false in general.\nCounterexample: $x^3-2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nCorrect Theorem: An intermediate field $E$ is Galois over $F$ iff the corresponding subgroup is normal in $\\text{Gal}(K/F)$.\nSpecial cases where it is true: Abelian Galois group, finite fields.\nSimilar true statement: $K$ is always Galois over $E$.\n\nI will write it out clearly.\n\nSteps for the final output:\n1.  **Direct Answer**: The statement is not true in general.\n2.  **Counterexample**: Use $f(x) = x^3-2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   Define $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\omega)$.\n    *   Show $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois (splitting field).\n    *   Define $E = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$.\n    *   Show $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ is not Galois (not normal, splitting field is $K$, not $E$).\n3.  **Group Theoretic Explanation**:\n    *   By FTGT, intermediate fields correspond to subgroups of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/F)$.\n    *   $E/F$ is Galois $\\iff \\text{Gal}(K/E) \\unlhd G$.\n    *   Not all subgroups of an arbitrary group are normal.\n    *   In the example, $G \\cong S_3$. $S_3$ has non-normal subgroups (e.g., corresponding to $E$).\n4.  **When is it true?**\n    *   If $G$ is abelian (all subgroups are normal).\n    *   If $F$ is a finite field (all finite extensions are Galois).\n5.  **Related True Statements**:\n    *   $K$ is always Galois over $E$.\n    *   $E$ is always separable over $F$.\n\nThis is a complete and pedagogical response.\n\nOne minor detail: $E$ corresponding to a normal subgroup means $E$ is Galois over $F$.\nIn $S_3$, subgroups of order 2 are not normal.\nThe fixed field of a subgroup of order 2 has degree $6/2 = 3$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$.\nSince the subgroup is not normal, the extension is not Galois.\nThis matches.\n\nFinal check on the wording \"Show that...\".\nUsually, if a student asks this, they might have misread a theorem or copied a homework question incorrectly. I should be gentle but firm on the math.\n\"This statement is actually false.
